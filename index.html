				<p>Hello and welcome into my foray into HTML and CSS.<br><br>Here are some things about me!</p>

					<ul>
						<li>In 2012, I organized a trip to San Diego with a few friends and we went to San Diego Comic Con. It was amazing, and I'm hoping to go back in the future. I really enjoy travelling and it's something that I hope I can do more of.</li>

						<li>I went to college for Fashion Design, but I have been sewing all of life. I used to design and make stuff animals from scratch, Halloween costumes, and miscellaneous other projects. Now I make clothing, though I haven't made anything new in a little while.</li>

						<li>I am voracious reader and I have a home library that is threatening to take over my room. I dream of having an actual room for all of my books, and more books of course.</li>

						<li>I can juggle. I'm not very good at it but I can.</li>

						<li>I also collected comics for 10 years but recently I sold most of my collection because the idea of moving with it was a nightmare.</li>
